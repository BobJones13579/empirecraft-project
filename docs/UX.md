## 3️⃣ UX Design Principles
- **Interactivity Over Static Notes:** The system actively **engages and challenges your thinking** with every entry—using questions, analogies, and cross-domain connections.  
- **Motion Design:** Smooth transitions (fade, slide) provide a seamless experience and clear flow.  
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple with focus entry, and reveal complex prompts and insights as engagement deepens.  
- **Simplicity First:** Minimal UI with essential interactions; keep the focus on deep thinking, not clutter.  
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, focus management, high contrast for visual clarity.  
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Prioritize ease of use on small screens, large touch targets, collapsible sections.  
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear priority on actions (input, engage), with secondary features (filters, settings) placed subtly.  
- **Suggested Tailwind:**  
  - Use `flex`, `grid`, `gap`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-md`, `p-4`, `text-lg` for clean layouts.  
  - Tailwind’s `transition-all`, `duration-300`, `ease-in-out` for smooth, responsive effects.
