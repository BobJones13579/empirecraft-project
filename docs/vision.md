# 🏛 Empirecraft Learning Engine – Vision Document (Refined & Aligned)


---


## 📚 Overview
Empirecraft is a personal **mental gym** designed to actively engage your thinking and deepen your understanding of strategic models, power structures, and decision-making patterns across history, business, and leadership. It’s not a static note-taking app or simple GPT wrapper—it’s a **dynamic, evolving system** that takes your raw reflections and transforms them into a compounding, interactive vault of knowledge and connections.


---


## 🎯 Core Goals
- Build an active system that **prods, challenges, and expands** your thinking with every session.
- Move beyond passive reading and isolated notes into **applied, critical synthesis** that compounds over time.
- Create an **interactive, evolving vault** of your mental models—visualized as a dynamic, interconnected network.
- Incorporate challenge prompts, analogies, and alternative perspectives to **sharpen judgment and reveal blind spots**.
- Construct a system so tied to your evolving mental map that **GPT alone couldn’t replicate it**.
